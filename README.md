# Background:
Per scholas is an online tuition-free school training buisness professional skills development with hands-on technical instruction for high demand jobs.


# Problem:
Per scholas wants to allow students who have graduated to have the opportunity to give back as a mentor/tutor in subjects such as Software engineering and more. Create a tutoring app called PeerTrack+ that alows alumni and current students to connect and learn for future student success, while integrating the latest AI assistive technologies.




# Achievement:  
We want to make a smart helper app called PeerTrack+ that benefits the community of the Per Scholas progam.


# Solution:
We have created and deigned this app to allow only three users: Admin, Leaner, and Tutor to log in. This app integrates a computer helper (AI) with OPEN AI that helps answer questions fast on the platform if a student requested.


Key Features:
-Only Alumni can apply and have access to login as tutors
-Current Students can request help from the AI integration, contact for support, or schedule a tutoring session
-Admin will be able to edit Almuni and student profiles, approve /deny tutoring applications, edit Tutor's point system




# Mission:
We created this app in hopes of improving the per scholas community from which we graduation to help solve the gap between learner and alumni mentorship by helping each other succeed.
